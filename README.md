# RestBuilder
Restbuilder will interpret http methods that are written like the restEx.rest example into node.js & objective-c code that will allow you to get server dependant apps up and running very rapidly.  

Check out the Rest/objc and Rest/js to see the files that were generated from the simple restEx.rest. Get method's work just fine and post, put, delete methods should work too, but they need more testing.

This project depends on JLexx, so you need to download it, include the proper files, and link against them in g++. I will do this in the future and make it nicer but this is just a prototype.
